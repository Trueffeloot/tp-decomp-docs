Follow these steps to set up the project.

## Set Up Dependencies

Following tools will be needed for the project:

* Python 3.6 or newer
* Make (which is included in build-essential in Linux/WSL2)

If you are using a distribution under Linux or WSL2, we highly recommend also installing:

* [Wine](https://discord.com/channels/688807550715560050/749052938282074153/1083148488596013066) for speeding up the compiling process (See the link for installing)
* [Wibo](https://github.com/decompals/wibo) for speeding up the process even more

If you are on MacOS (only intel-based ones), only install: 

* Wine (Install it with the MacOS step below)

Linux/WSL2:
```shell
sudo apt install build-essential python3
```

MacOS:
```shell
brew install python
```
```shell
xcode-select --install
```
```shell
brew cask install wine-stable
```

## Setting Up The Repository

1. Clone the repository and switch to it by running:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/zeldaret/tp.git && cd tp 
```

2. Place your copy of NTSC-U GCN Twilight Princess in the root directory and call it `gz2e01.iso`

3. You will need specific python modules which can be installed with following command:
```shell
python3 -m pip install --user -r tools/requirements.txt
```

4. Execute tp.py with the setup argument like this:
```shell
./tp setup
```

## Building The Game

1. To build a playable game, run:
```shell
make game
```
NOTE: You can add the `-j#` argument where # is the amount of threads your system has in order to greatly speed up build times
Example:
```shell
make game -j8
```

2. Create the Expected directory (for diffing asm functions via diff.py):
```shell
./tp expected
```
