Follow these steps to set up the project.

## Set Up Dependencies

Following tools will be needed for the project:

* Python 3.6 or newer
* Make (which is included in build-essential in Linux/WSL2)

If you are using a distribution under Linux or WSL2, we highly recommend also installing one of these tools:

* Wine for speeding up the compiling process

OR

* [WiBo](https://github.com/decompals/wibo) for speeding up the process even more

You can install either WiBo or Wine but you should only install one of them. We recommend to install WiBo because it is faster in building.

If you are on MacOS (only intel-based ones), only install: 

* Wine (Install it with the MacOS step below)

Linux/WSL2:
```shell
sudo apt install build-essential python3
```
And if you chose to install Wine instead of WiBo:
```shell
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
```
```shell
sudo apt-get update
```
```shell
sudo apt-get install wine wine32
```

MacOS:
```shell
brew install python
```
```shell
xcode-select --install
```
```shell
brew cask install wine-stable
```

## Setting Up The Repository

1. Clone the repository and switch to it by running:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/zeldaret/tp.git && cd tp 
```

2. Place your copy of NTSC-U GCN Twilight Princess in the root directory and call it `gz2e01.iso`

3. You will need specific python modules which can be installed with following command:
```shell
python3 -m pip install --user -r tools/requirements.txt
```

4. Execute tp.py with the setup argument like this:
```shell
./tp setup
```

## Building The Game

1. To build a playable game, run:
```shell
make game
```
NOTE: You can add the `-j#` argument where # is the amount of threads your system has in order to greatly speed up build times.
Example:
```shell
make game -j8
```
NOTE: To actually make use of WiBo (if installed), you would need to execute the Makefile like this:
```shell
make game WINE=wibo
```
Where you can and should of course use the `-j#` argument too (before WINE=wibo)

2. Create the Expected directory (for diffing asm functions via diff.py):
```shell
./tp expected
```

### Extra Informations About The Makefile
